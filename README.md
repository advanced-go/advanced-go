# Advanced Go

Advanced Go is an exercise in creating a new software engineering paradigm that would streamline application development, improve testing efficacy, and alleviate some of the things that are hard to change with a microservices architecture. This solution to creating a new paradigm was extending REST from the service/HTTP layer to the application layer. What follows are the implementation details of a new software engineering paradigm.

## REST Uniform Interface & Resource Identifier
A key concept of REST is the uniform inerface. A [package's][domainservice] HttpHandler implements that uniform interaface, and allows easy integration with other packages.A package also includes a PkgPath that can be used as an identifier

[Error handling][errorhandler] also benefits from a uniform interface, allowing [generice type's][loghandler] for implementation. 

[Access logging][logger] also has a uniform Log function.  


## REST Intermediaries
REST defines a layered architecture style where RESTful components can be easily connected via HTTP. Service authenticaion/authorization are implemented by adding an [intermediary][intermediary].


[Messaging][messagingpkg] was developmented to provied ease of interactions between a network of heterogenous agents, working together satisify the goals of an AI Agent.
