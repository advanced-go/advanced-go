# Advanced Go

Advanced Go is an exercise in development of architectures to facilitate the development of AI Agents. Inspiration for the AI Agent architecture is defined in the AI text book by [Stewart Russell & Peter Norvig][aima]. The textbook defines an AI Agent as follows:
~~~
An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environmentthrough sensors and acting upon that environment
through effectors.
