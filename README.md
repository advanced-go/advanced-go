# Advanced Go

Advanced Go is an exercise in creating [a better way to write software][robpike], by extending REST from the service/HTTP layer to the application layer. The following implementations frame a new application software development paradigm based on REST. 

Go is a project to makeÂ building production software easier and more productive

1. Reduce complexity via uniform interface
2. Increase solution expressiveness -  
3. Reduce toil of service development.
 
## REST Applied to Packages
1. Uniform interface - httphandler
2. REST Constraints - resource identifier - PkgPath, manipulation through representation, and self descriptive message. http.Request and Http.Response
Expressiveness - ability to compose resources/packages from already tested packages. Dynamic topography, mobile code.
Funcionality via intermediaries

## REST Applied to Error Handling and Logging
Expressiveness - 
1. Uniform interface - ErrorHandler and logging. loging interface allows expresiveness
2. Constraints - resource identifier - PkgPath, manipulation through representation, and self descriptive message. http.Request and Http.Response
[Error handling][errorhandler] also benefits from a uniform interface, allowing [generice type's][loghandler] for implementation. 

[Access logging][logger] also has a uniform Log function.  Expressive - Add traffic differentiation, ingress, egress, and internal

## REST Applied to Testing
Uniform interface - Resolver build with configurable templates. Expressiveness - Configurable templates to handle different URL resolution for development envirnment

## REST Applied to URLs
Treating a URL as a resource, where manipulation of the URL is through a representation, allows for that representation to change based on runtime environment/time. A [resolver type][resolver], provides the representations of a URL, and is the mechanism used to generate file scheme URL (file://) for testing and HTTPS scheme URL (https://) for runtime environments.


## REST Uniform Interface, Resource Identifier, & Self-Descriptive Messages
A key concept of REST is the uniform interface. A [package's][domainservice] HttpHandler implements that uniform interface, uses the http.Request type and allows easy integration with other packages. A package also includes a PkgPath that is used as an identifier for routing and error tracing.

The messaging package provides a [uniform interface][msgsend], [self-descriptive message][msgcore], and [resource identification][msgcore] for communication between resources using goroutines and Go channels. Functionality supported by messaging include startup, shutdown, and package health checks.



## REST Intermediaries
REST defines a layered architecture style where RESTful components can be easily connected via HTTP. Service authentication/authorization functionality is implemented by adding an [intermediary][intermediary].


## Testing
Testing utilizes a package's HttpHandler to test all requests and related responses. The requests and responses are HTTP text files, deserialized from disk into the appropriate [http.Request][httprequest] and [http.Response][httpresponse] types. This allows an automated, easy to extend solution for testing. Since the package HttpHandler is the public interface for the package, no further testing of the package needs to be done in a host.  

## Application Development
Development is streamlined as applications can be composed of existing resources/packages or resources in existing services.
